# Overview

## Overview

**BankAlpy** is a backend project built in **Java** to practice object-oriented design, persistence, testing, and backend architecture.  
The project is structured around the **MVC pattern**:  
- **Model** → Domain entities (`Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`, `Loan`)  
- **View** → A simple **CLI interface** in the first versions (later replaced with REST endpoints)  
- **Controller** → Orchestration layer managing business logic  

It starts with in-memory storage (`HashMap` / `List`), then integrates with **H2 Database** for SQL persistence, and later migrates to **Spring Boot** to expose APIs.

---

## Features
✅ MVC architecture (Model–View–Controller)  
✅ In-memory persistence with Lists / HashMaps  
✅ Domain entities: `Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`, `Loan`  
✅ Basic Controller + CLI view  
✅ Unit tests with JUnit  

🚧 Planned:  
- DAO interfaces for persistence abstraction  
- SQL integration with **H2 Database**  
- Migration to Spring Boot with REST API (View layer replaced)  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
- Optional migration to Postgres/MySQL in production

---

## Goals
- Learn backend development in Java.
- Start with simple persistence (arrays, hashmaps).
- Evolve to SQL persistence.
- Use Maven and later migrate to Spring Boot.
- Implement JUnit testing.
