# BankAlpy
A Java backend learning project for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and loans.  
Incrementally built with **Maven**, following an **MVC (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller) architecture**, evolving from in-memory storage to **H2 SQL** and eventually **Spring Boot REST API**.

## Overview
**BankAlpy** is a backend project built in **Java** to practice object-oriented design, persistence, testing, and backend architecture.  
The project is structured around the **MVC pattern**:  
- **Model** â†’ Domain entities (`Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`, `Loan`)  
- **View** â†’ A simple **CLI interface** in the first versions (later replaced with REST endpoints)  
- **Controller** â†’ Orchestration layer managing business logic  

It starts with in-memory storage (`HashMap` / `List`), then integrates with **H2 Database** for SQL persistence, and later migrates to **Spring Boot** to expose APIs.

---

## Features
âœ… MVC architecture (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller)  
âœ… In-memory persistence with Lists / HashMaps  
âœ… Domain entities: `Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`, `Loan`  
âœ… Basic Controller + CLI view  
âœ… Unit tests with JUnit  

ðŸš§ Planned:  
- DAO interfaces for persistence abstraction  
- SQL integration with **H2 Database**  
- Migration to Spring Boot with REST API (View layer replaced)  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
- Optional migration to Postgres/MySQL in production

Welcome to **BankAlpy**, a backend-focused project built in **Java** that evolves from in-memory persistence to a full **SQL database** implementation.  
The goal is to learn and apply best practices while scaling the project step by step.
